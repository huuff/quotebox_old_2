# Tasks
## Backend
* Photos on authors
* Extended reference pattern in quote (to author)
* See if I can return descriptive messages for bad requests
* A regex so quotes can only be valid words?
* Auth should be in OpenAPI too, I guess
* Full text search in `text`
* Retrieving quotes liked by a user like:
  * By params, and paged
  * Randomly and by params
* Return whether a quote is liked in the `QuoteDto`
* Add kover
* An integration test for oAuth? Seems like hard
* Controller advice for handling validation errors
* Maybe caching headers on responses?
